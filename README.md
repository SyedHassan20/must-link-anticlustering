# must-link-anticlustering

- Directory `Application` contains code for the example application
- Directory `Running_Time_Optimal_Algorithm` has code that investigates the feasibility of an optimal algorithm for must-link anticlustering
- Directory `Simulation_vs_OSAT` implements a simulation that compares the quality of the OSAT method and anticlustering
- Directory `Supplementary_Materials` has a document that might be used as supplementary information to a short report (describing the anticlustering method and the must-link addition in more detail than is possible in the main paper). It is an ongoing writing process.
